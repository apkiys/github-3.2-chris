#### what is GitHub Authentication and how what methods available to be implemented?
GitHub Authentication is a way for people to prove their identity and access certain features on GitHub, a platform for hosting and collaborating on software projects. It ensures that only authorized individuals can perform actions like uploading code or accessing sensitive information.

There are different methods available for authentication on GitHub:

Username and Password: Users enter their username and password to log in. It's the most basic method, but it's not very secure.

Personal Access Tokens: Users can create special tokens instead of using their passwords. These tokens have limited permissions and can be used for automated tasks.

OAuth Apps: Developers can create special applications that connect to GitHub using the OAuth protocol. It allows users to authorize the app to access their GitHub account without sharing their password.

GitHub Apps: These are powerful apps that can be installed directly on repositories or organizations. They have their own authentication tokens and can access GitHub on behalf of users.

Web Application Flow: This method involves users being redirected to GitHub to log in and authorize an application. After authorization, they are sent back to the app with a special code.

Device Flow: This method is for devices like TVs or game consoles with limited input. It displays a code on the device and asks the user to enter it on a GitHub webpage to authenticate.

These methods provide different levels of security and control depending on the needs of the user or application.
